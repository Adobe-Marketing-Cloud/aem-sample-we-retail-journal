# Spa Angular Editable Components

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.1.

This application is build to consume the AEM model of a site. It will automatically generate the layout using the helper components from [https://www.npmjs.com/package/@adobe/cq-angular-editable-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@adobe/cq-angular-editable-components)

That is why the main code of this application consists out of components.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build the library

Run `ng build` to build the library. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/cq-angular-editable-components` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
